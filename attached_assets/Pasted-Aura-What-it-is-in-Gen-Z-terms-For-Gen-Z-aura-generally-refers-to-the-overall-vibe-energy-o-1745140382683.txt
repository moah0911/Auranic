Aura
What it is (in Gen Z terms):

For Gen Z, "aura" generally refers to the overall vibe, energy, or atmosphere a person exudes. It's less about the mystical or spiritual interpretations and more about the distinctive quality or character someone projects through their actions, style, and how they carry themselves. Someone with a "good aura" might be seen as cool, respectable, positive, or having a strong, admirable presence. You might hear phrases like "they have a great aura about them" or "their aura is so chill." Sometimes, "aura points" are jokingly awarded for doing something particularly cool or commendable. Conversely, someone could have a "negative aura."   

How to analyze it (in Gen Z terms):

Analyzing someone's aura, in this context, is more about observing and interpreting their overall presentation and the feeling they give off. It's subjective and based on a combination of factors:

Vibe Check: This is a primary way Gen Z assesses someone's aura. It involves intuitively sensing the emotional and energetic atmosphere a person brings. Are they positive and uplifting? Calm and collected? Intense or unsettling?
Behavior and Actions: How does the person interact with others? Are they kind, confident, genuine, helpful? Do their actions align with a positive or admirable character?
Style and Presentation: Their fashion sense, grooming, and how they present themselves can contribute to their perceived aura. Someone who is put-together and confident in their style might project a stronger aura.   
Confidence and Demeanor: How do they carry themselves? Do they exude self-assurance without being arrogant? Their body language and how they hold themselves play a role.
Impact on Others: How do people react to them? Do others seem drawn to their energy? Do they create a positive or negative atmosphere in a room?
It's important to note that this Gen Z understanding of "aura" is often more casual and less tied to traditional spiritual beliefs. It's about the observable and felt presence of an individual.

Rizz
What it is (in Gen Z terms):

"Rizz" is a Gen Z slang term that is short for charisma. It specifically refers to someone's ability to charm or seduce another person. It's about having "game" or being a smooth talker, especially in romantic or flirtatious contexts. Someone with "rizz" can effortlessly attract others and knows how to use their words and demeanor to their advantage. You might hear "he's got mad rizz" or "she rizzed him up." There can also be "W rizz" (successful rizz) or "L rizz" (unsuccessful rizz). "Unspoken rizz" refers to attracting someone through confidence and body language alone.   

How to analyze it (in Gen Z terms):

Analyzing someone's rizz involves observing their flirtatious interactions and their ability to attract others. Key aspects to consider include:

Verbal Fluency and Charm: How skilled are they at conversation, especially when flirting? Do they know how to make someone laugh, give compliments, and keep the interaction engaging?
Confidence and Smoothness: Do they approach others with confidence? Are their advances smooth and natural, or do they come across as awkward or trying too hard?
Body Language: Do they make eye contact? Have open and inviting body language? Their non-verbal cues contribute significantly to their rizz.
Humor and Banter: Can they use humor effectively? Are they good at playful banter and witty remarks?
Success Rate: While not always directly observable, the outcome of their flirtatious attempts can be an indicator of their rizz. Do they often get the number, secure a date, or generally leave a positive impression?
Authenticity: While confidence is key, genuine interest and authenticity are also important aspects of good rizz. Coming across as fake or overly rehearsed can diminish rizz.
